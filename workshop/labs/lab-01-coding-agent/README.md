# Lab 01 — Coding Agent: "Zero to PR"

| | |
|---|---|
| **Toil** | Translating GitHub issues into working code |
| **Feature** | GitHub Copilot Coding Agent |
| **Time** | 45–60 minutes |
| **Difficulty** | Beginner |
| **Prerequisites** | GitHub repo with Copilot enabled, Coding Agent enabled in org settings |

## Toil Scorecard

| Metric | Without Copilot | With Copilot |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| Time to first PR | 2–4 hours | ~15 min wait |
| Files touched manually | 7–8 files | 0 files |
| Context switches | 5–10 (docs, ERD, patterns) | 0 |
| Cognitive load | High | Low (review only) |

## What You'll Do

You will create a GitHub issue describing a new API entity, assign it to **Copilot Coding Agent**, and watch it autonomously plan, implement, test, and open a PR — all without writing a single line of code yourself.

---

## Part A — Understanding the Pattern (5 min)

Before we start, glance at one existing entity to understand what the Coding Agent will need to produce.

> **Don't code anything.** Just look.

Open these 4 files and skim the structure:

| File | What to notice |
|------|---------------|
| [api/src/models/product.ts](../../../api/src/models/product.ts) | TypeScript interface + Swagger `@swagger` JSDoc |
| [api/src/repositories/productsRepo.ts](../../../api/src/repositories/productsRepo.ts) | Repository class: `findAll`, `findById`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `exists` |
| [api/src/routes/product.ts](../../../api/src/routes/product.ts) | Express routes with Swagger docs — CRUD endpoints |
| [api/database/migrations/001_init.sql](../../../api/database/migrations/001_init.sql) | SQL schema for all tables — see the `products` table |

**Key insight:** Every entity in this app follows the same pattern: **Model → Repository → Routes → Migration → Seed → Tests.** The codebase also has a Copilot Skill at `.github/skills/api-endpoint/SKILL.md` that teaches this pattern to Copilot.

---

## Part B — Create the GitHub Issue (10 min)

### Step 1: Create the issue using MCP

Instead of manually copying issue descriptions, use the **GitHub MCP server** to create the issue directly from Copilot Chat.

1. Open **Copilot Chat** (Ctrl+Shift+I) → select **Agent** mode
2. Type the following prompt:

```
Using the GitHub MCP server, create a new issue using the 
"New API Entity" issue template. Fill it in for a "DeliveryVehicle" 
entity that tracks vehicles used by suppliers for deliveries.

Fields:
- deliveryVehicleId (integer, PK, auto)
- supplierId (integer, FK to suppliers, required)
- vehicleType (text, required — e.g. "Truck", "Van", "Drone")
- licensePlate (text, required, unique)
- capacity (number, required — max cargo weight in kg)
- status (text, required — "available", "in-transit", "maintenance")
- lastInspectionDate (text, optional — ISO 8601 date)

Include an extra endpoint: GET /api/delivery-vehicles/supplier/:supplierId.
Add constraints: UNIQUE on licensePlate, FK to suppliers with ON DELETE CASCADE, 
CHECK on status. Assign the issue to Copilot.
```

3. Copilot will read the issue template, fill in all sections (data model, endpoints, checklist, constraints, acceptance criteria), and create the issue.

<details>
<summary>💡 <strong>Alternative:</strong> Create the issue manually on GitHub.com</summary>

If you prefer, go to your GitHub repo → **Issues** → **New Issue** → select the **"New API Entity"** template and fill it in for a `DeliveryVehicle` entity with the fields listed above.

</details>

### Step 2: Verify the issue

Open your GitHub repo → **Issues** and confirm the issue was created with the full template filled in. Note the issue number (e.g., `#1`).

---

## Part C — Assign to Copilot Coding Agent (5 min)

### Step 3: Assign the issue to Copilot

On the issue page:

1. In the right sidebar, click **Assignees**
2. Select **Copilot** from the list
3. Copilot will begin working within ~30 seconds

> **What happens next:** Copilot Coding Agent reads the issue, analyzes the codebase (including the `api-endpoint` skill and custom instructions), creates a plan, implements all files, runs tests, and opens a PR — all autonomously.

### Step 4: Watch the progress

1. Click on the **Copilot icon** in the issue to see its work session
2. You'll see Copilot:
   - Analyzing the codebase structure
   - Reading existing patterns (models, repos, routes)
   - Creating each file listed in the checklist
   - Running `npm run build` and `npm test`
   - Opening a PR when done

> **Typical wait time:** 5–15 minutes depending on complexity.

---

## Part D — Review the PR (15 min)

### Step 5: Open the PR

When Copilot opens the PR, click through to review it.

**Check each file against the expected pattern:**

| File | What to verify |
|------|---------------|
| `deliveryVehicle.ts` (model) | Has `@swagger` JSDoc, all 7 fields, correct types |
| `deliveryVehiclesRepo.ts` (repo) | Has all CRUD methods + `findBySupplierId`, uses parameterized SQL, factory/singleton pattern |
| `deliveryVehicle.ts` (routes) | Has Swagger docs for all 6 endpoints, proper status codes (201, 204, 404) |
| `index.ts` | Route registered: `app.use('/api/delivery-vehicles', ...)` |
| `003_add_delivery_vehicles.sql` | CREATE TABLE with FK, UNIQUE on `licensePlate`, CHECK on `status` |
| `005_delivery_vehicles.sql` | 4–5 rows with realistic data referencing supplier IDs 1–4 |
| `deliveryVehiclesRepo.test.ts` | Tests for `findAll`, `findById`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `exists` |

### Step 6: Leave review feedback

Try providing feedback on the PR to see Copilot iterate:

1. Click **Review changes** → leave a comment like:

```
Add a `findByStatus` method to the repository that filters vehicles by status.
Also add a GET endpoint: `/api/delivery-vehicles/status/:status`
```

2. Submit as **Request changes**
3. Watch Copilot read your feedback, implement the changes, and push a new commit

### Step 7: Approve and merge

Once satisfied:
1. Click **Review changes** → **Approve**
2. Click **Merge pull request**

---

## Part E — Verify It Works (10 min)

### Step 8: Pull and run

```bash
git pull origin master
cd api
npm run dev
```

### Step 9: Test the new endpoints

Open a new terminal and run:

**Bash / macOS / Linux:**

```bash
# List all vehicles
curl http://localhost:3000/api/delivery-vehicles

# Get vehicle by ID
curl http://localhost:3000/api/delivery-vehicles/1

# Create a new vehicle
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/delivery-vehicles \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"supplierId": 1, "vehicleType": "Drone", "licensePlate": "DRONE-001", "capacity": 5, "status": "available"}'
```

**PowerShell (Windows):**

```powershell
# List all vehicles
Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:3000/api/delivery-vehicles

# Get vehicle by ID
Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:3000/api/delivery-vehicles/1

# Create a new vehicle
Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:3000/api/delivery-vehicles `
  -Method Post -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Body '{"supplierId": 1, "vehicleType": "Drone", "licensePlate": "DRONE-001", "capacity": 5, "status": "available"}'
```

```
# Check Swagger docs
# Open http://localhost:3000/api-docs in browser — find "DeliveryVehicles" tag
```

### Step 10: Run the test suite

In the same terminal from Step 9, run:

```bash
cd api
npm test
```

All tests (including the new `deliveryVehiclesRepo.test.ts`) should pass.

## Key Takeaway

> **You went from a GitHub issue to a fully tested, reviewed, and merged feature — without writing a single line of code.** The Coding Agent used the repo's existing patterns, the `api-endpoint` skill, and the custom instructions to produce production-quality code.

### What Made This Work

- **Skill** (`.github/skills/api-endpoint/SKILL.md`): Taught Copilot the exact entity pattern
- **Custom instructions** (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`): Set repo-wide standards
- **Path-scoped instructions** (`.github/instructions/api.instructions.md`): API-specific rules
- **Well-structured issue**: Detailed requirements = better output
- **Existing patterns**: Copilot learned from the existing entities in the codebase

## Bonus Challenge (Optional, 15 min)

Create a **second issue** for a `Warehouse` entity:

**Title:** `Add Warehouse entity with full CRUD API`

Use the same issue template pattern above but with these fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `warehouseId` | integer | PK |
| `name` | string | Warehouse name |
| `location` | string | Address |
| `capacity` | number | Max storage in cubic meters |
| `supplierId` | integer | FK to suppliers |
| `active` | boolean | Whether warehouse is operational |

Assign to Copilot and compare the quality with your first experience.
