# Lab 06 — Parallel Delegation & Agent HQ: "Batch It"

| | |
|---|---|
| **Toil** | Context switching between multiple small tasks sequentially |
| **Feature** | Copilot Coding Agent (parallel) + Agent HQ |
| **Time** | 45–60 minutes |
| **Difficulty** | Intermediate |
| **Prerequisites** | GitHub repo with Copilot Coding Agent enabled, org allows multiple sessions |

## Toil Scorecard

| Metric | Without Copilot | With Parallel Agents |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| 3 independent tasks | 3–4 hours (sequential) | ~20 min wait (parallel) |
| Context switches | 6–10 | 0 |
| Developer time spent coding | 3+ hours | 0 (review only) |
| Tasks completed per hour | 1 | 3+ |

## What You'll Do

You will create **3 GitHub issues simultaneously**, assign all of them to Copilot Coding Agent, monitor them in **Agent HQ**, and review/merge the resulting PRs — all running in parallel.

---

## Part A — Identify the Work (5 min)

### The Problem

Your backlog has a mix of tasks — backend tests, documentation, frontend UI fixes. Doing them one at a time means constant context switching. But these tasks are **independent** — perfect for parallel delegation.

| Task | Type | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| Unit tests for `productsRepo.ts` | Backend Testing | → Issue #1 |
| Architecture diagrams & docs update | Documentation | → Issue #2 |
| Custom 404 "Lost Cat" page | Frontend UI | → Issue #3 |

---

## Part B — Create 3 Issues (10 min)

### Step 1: Create Issue #1 — Products Repo Tests

Go to GitHub → **Issues** → **New Issue**:

**Title:** `Add unit tests for productsRepo.ts`

**Body:**

```markdown
## Summary

Add comprehensive unit tests for `api/src/repositories/productsRepo.ts`.

## Implementation

- Create `api/src/repositories/productsRepo.test.ts`
- Follow the exact pattern in `api/src/repositories/suppliersRepo.test.ts`
- Use mock database with `vi.fn()` — do NOT use real database
- Test all methods: `findAll`, `findById`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `exists`, `findBySupplierId`, `findByName`

## Test Cases Required

For each method:
1. ✅ Happy path — valid input returns expected output
2. ✅ Empty/not found — returns empty array or null
3. ✅ Error handling — database errors are propagated via `handleDatabaseError`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `npm test` passes with all new tests
- [ ] No real database connections — all tests use mocks
- [ ] Test file follows `suppliersRepo.test.ts` structure exactly
```

### Step 2: Create Issue #2 — Architecture Diagrams & Docs

> **Note:** This issue uses the `@doc-generator` custom agent defined in `.github/agents/doc-generator.agent.md`. The agent knows how to read source files and produce Mermaid diagrams — so the issue body can stay concise.

**Title:** `Generate architecture diagrams and update documentation`

**Body:**

```markdown
## Summary

@doc-generator — Generate Mermaid architecture diagrams and update `docs/architecture.md`.

## Diagrams to Add

1. **API Request Lifecycle** (sequenceDiagram) — Client → Express → Route → Repository → SQLite → Response, including error path
2. **Frontend-to-Backend Data Flow** (flowchart) — React component → API client → Express route → Repository → DB, using Products as example
3. **Project Structure Overview** (flowchart) — Monorepo map of `api/`, `frontend/`, `docs/`, `infra/` with key subdirectories
4. **Deployment Architecture** (flowchart) — Docker Compose (local) and Azure Container Apps (production), read from `docker-compose.yml` and `infra/container-apps.bicep`

## Rules

- Preserve existing ERD and Component Architecture diagrams — append new sections
- Add a table of contents linking to all diagram sections
- Each diagram gets a short text description above it
- Read actual source files for accuracy — do not use placeholders

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `docs/architecture.md` contains at least 6 Mermaid diagrams (4 new + 2 existing)
- [ ] All diagrams render correctly on GitHub
- [ ] Diagrams reflect the actual codebase (not generic content)
```

### Step 3: Create Issue #3 — Custom 404 Page

**Title:** `Add a custom 404 "Lost Cat" page`

**Body:**

```markdown
## Summary

Add a fun, on-brand 404 page so users who navigate to an invalid route see a friendly "Lost Cat" message instead of a blank screen.

## Implementation

- Create `frontend/src/components/NotFound.tsx`
- Add a catch-all `<Route path="*">` in `frontend/src/App.tsx`
- Follow existing component patterns (Tailwind CSS, dark mode support via `useTheme`)

## Design Requirements

- Large centered "404" heading
- Fun subheading like "This cat wandered off..." or "Looks like this page used all 9 lives"
- A cat-themed emoji or ASCII art (🐱 or text art)
- A "Back to Home" button linking to `/`
- Must support dark mode (`dark:` Tailwind classes)
- Responsive layout (looks good on mobile and desktop)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Navigating to `/some-random-path` shows the 404 page
- [ ] "Back to Home" button navigates to `/`
- [ ] Dark mode works correctly
- [ ] Matches the app's visual style (Tailwind, same color palette)
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds with no errors
```

## Part C — Assign All 3 to Copilot (5 min)

### Step 4: Assign issues to Copilot

For **each** of the 3 issues:
1. Open the issue
2. Click **Assignees** in the right sidebar
3. Select **Copilot**

> Do this quickly for all 3 — the goal is to have all 3 running simultaneously.

### Step 5: Open Agent HQ

1. Go to your GitHub repo page
2. Click the **Copilot** icon in the top navigation
3. You'll see **Agent HQ** — a dashboard showing all active Copilot sessions

You should see 3 sessions running in parallel:
- Session for productsRepo tests
- Session for architecture diagrams & docs
- Session for 404 page

---

## Part D — Monitor in Agent HQ (10 min)

### Step 6: Watch the progress

In Agent HQ, each session shows:
- **Status**: Planning → Implementing → Testing → PR Ready
- **Files being modified**: The test file being created
- **Build status**: Whether `npm test` passes

### Step 7: Compare approaches

While waiting, note how each session independently works on **completely different parts** of the codebase:

| Session | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| productsRepo tests | Reads `suppliersRepo.test.ts` as pattern → creates test file → runs `npm test` |
| architecture diagrams | Reads source files across the codebase → generates Mermaid diagrams → updates `docs/architecture.md` |
| 404 page | Reads existing components for style → creates `NotFound.tsx` → updates `App.tsx` routes → runs `npm run build` |

**All 3 happen simultaneously** — backend tests, documentation, and frontend UI, all at once.

---

## Part E — Review and Merge (20 min)

### Step 8: Review PR #1 — Products Repo Tests

When the first PR appears:
1. Open it and review the test file
2. Verify it mirrors `suppliersRepo.test.ts` structure:
   - `describe('ProductsRepository')` 
   - Tests for each method
   - Mock DB setup
   - Happy path + edge cases
3. Check that tests actually test the right methods (`findBySupplierId`, `findByName` are Products-specific)

### Step 9: Review PR #2 — Architecture Diagrams 📐

1. Open the PR and check the updated `docs/architecture.md`
2. Verify all 4 new Mermaid diagrams are present (API lifecycle, data flow, project structure, deployment)
3. Confirm the existing ERD and Component Architecture diagrams are preserved
4. Preview the file on GitHub to ensure all diagrams render correctly
5. Check that diagrams reflect actual code structure (not generic placeholders)

### Step 10: Review PR #3 — 404 Page 🐱

This one is the fun one:
1. Open the PR and check `NotFound.tsx`
2. Verify it has a cat-themed message and a "Back to Home" button
3. Check that `App.tsx` has a `<Route path="*">` catch-all
4. Pull the branch and navigate to `http://localhost:5137/does-not-exist` — enjoy the 404 page!

### Step 11: Merge all 3 PRs

Once reviewed:
1. Merge PR #1
2. Merge PR #2
3. Merge PR #3

### Step 12: Verify everything works together

```bash
git pull origin master
make test
make build
```

- All tests (original + new test file) should pass
- `docs/architecture.md` has 6 Mermaid diagrams that render on GitHub
- Frontend builds with the new 404 page
- Navigate to `http://localhost:5137/xyz` to see the 404 page live

## Key Takeaway

> **Parallel delegation turns sequential hours into parallel minutes.** Three independent tasks that would take 3+ hours back-to-back completed simultaneously while you did other work. Agent HQ gives you a control panel to monitor all sessions.

### What Made This Work

- **Mixed task types**: Backend tests + documentation + frontend UI — Copilot handles all in parallel
- **Independent tasks**: No dependencies between the 3 issues
- **Clear reference patterns**: `suppliersRepo.test.ts` for tests, existing docs for diagrams, existing components for UI
- **Well-structured issues**: Specific requirements = consistent output across all 3
- **Agent HQ**: Dashboard to monitor all sessions without context switching

## Bonus Challenge (Optional, 15 min)

Create issues for additional untested repositories (`branchesRepo`, `headquartersRepo`, `deliveriesRepo`, `ordersRepo`) and assign all to Copilot simultaneously. Can you get 5+ parallel sessions running?
